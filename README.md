# 🚀 Invoice Tracker 2: Automated Tracking & Processing

A production-grade, enterprise-scale invoice management system built with **Next.js 15**. This platform automates the end-to-end invoice lifecycle—from ingestion and AI-driven digitization to 3-way matching and multi-role approval workflows.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔍 Smart Ingestion & AI Digitization
- **Automated Capture**: Multi-channel ingestion support (Email, SharePoint, Portal) for PDF, Images, and Excel.
- **AI-Powered OCR**: High-accuracy data extraction (Invoice #, Date, Amounts, Line Items) using Tesseract.js.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HIL)**: Dedicated interface for Finance users to review and correct low-confidence extractions.
- **Document Persistence**: All uploaded documents stored in MongoDB using Base64 encoding for complete auditability.

### ⚖️ 3-Way Matching Engine
- **Intelligent Reconciliation**: Automated matching of **Invoice + Purchase Order + Ringi Annexures**.
- **Variance Control**: Configurable tolerance levels (±5%) with automated discrepancy flagging.
- **Line Item Detail**: Granular validation of quantities, unit prices, and descriptions.
- **Discrepancy Status**: Invoice status set to `MATCH_DISCREPANCY` when validation fails.

### 👥 Role-Based Governance
- **Tailored Portals**: Custom dashboards and workflows for **Admin, Project Manager, Finance User, and Vendors**.
- **Audit Trail**: Full enterprise logging for compliance (SOX/IFRS ready) and 7-year data retention.
- **Secure RBAC**: Sophisticated access control ensuring data privacy and operational security.
- **PM Delegation**: Project Managers can delegate responsibilities to other PMs with expiration dates.

### 📊 Analytics & Monitoring
- **Real-time Metrics**: Cycle time tracking, OCR accuracy rates, approval volumes, and processing speeds.
- **System Health**: Admin-only health monitoring with database status, latency metrics, memory usage, and uptime tracking.
- **Savings Estimation**: Automated calculation of cost savings from automation.
- **Status Distribution**: Visual breakdown of invoice statuses across the workflow.

### 🔄 Invoice Workflow
- **Status Hierarchy**: `manually_submitted` → `PENDING` → `VERIFIED` → `APPROVED` → `PAID`
- **Exception Pathing**: `REJECTED`, `MATCH_DISCREPANCY`, `VALIDATION_REQUIRED` statuses for edge cases
- **Dual Approval System**: Separate PM and Finance approval workflows with independent tracking
- **Auto-Vendor Creation**: Vendors automatically created if they don't exist during invoice submission

## 📊 RBAC Filtering Logic

### Invoice Visibility Rules

**Admin & Finance User:**
- Can view all invoices in the system
- Enriches invoice data with `vendorCode` for display purposes

**Project Manager:**
- Views invoices for projects in their `assignedProjects` array
- Views invoices where `assignedPM` matches their user ID
- Views invoices for projects they've been delegated to (via `delegatedTo`)
- Access delegation with expiration dates via `delegationExpiresAt`

**Vendor:**
- Views only invoices where `submittedByUserId` matches their user ID
- Security-focused: no name/email matching, strict userId filter only
